# Who Am I?

Hello, my name is **David boeger**, or @dboeger1 here on GitHub.

Professionally, I primarily write software in C and Python, although I've done
work in any number of languages and frameworks, including quite a bit of Java
and shell scripting. I'm currently learning modern C++ after a long absence
since the pre-C++11 days, and am also planning to learn Rust in the near
future.

My personal software projects outside of my day job are centered around video
games and personal finance. These projects will generally be managed under the
GitHub organization @SlugGames unless I am working on something limited in
scope that is more appropriately located under my personal space. At the time
of this writing (August 29, 2021), I'm deleting all of my old projects, as they
are no longer of value to me or others. I apologize if this means I've deleted
sources from one of my early jam games or something that you liked, but
hopefully, my newer projects will be more useful and interesting anyway.
